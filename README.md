These are my projects for the [Free Code Camp course](http://freecodecamp.com).

Here are my [algorithm exercises](/blob/master/algorithms.js).

And [here are all of the projects](/tree/master/app). I have my projects that are totally final also linked from my portfolio site [here](http://lopesdesign.com/fcc-projects)

I'm using my usual build system here so within /app you could have a look at pre-processor files (jade/scss) or finals (html/css).
